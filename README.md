# Enron POI

[PROJECT WEBSITE](https://siokcronin.github.io/enron_poi/index.html)

## Overview

The goal of Enron POI is to determine persons of interest (POI) involved in the Enron financial scandel by analyzing publically available company data (personnel financials and communications). This project employes the assistance of machine learning classifiers to alogorithmically calculate the liklihood of plausible POI classifications from the cmopany data. With this project I am interested in seeking what computational tools will help us glean vaulable insights into possible POIs.
